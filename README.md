This project was created to compare the quality of discussion among several subreddits. Included is a function to find the average word length of comments in given subreddits and a function to find the spelling correctness of comments in given subreddits. To get started, you must first install a couple of packages by entering `pip install praw` and `pip install pyspellchecker`. Next, you must register with reddit to get an API key in order to use the praw package. From there you can use the functions in the "lengths" and "spelling" files to do the data collection and analysis. The functions in "visualizations" are for visualizing the data collected after it has been analyzed.
